# Portfolio - Jason Horst

Welcome to my portfolio, [JasonHorst.net](https://jasonhorst.net/) A showcase of my web development skills and creative projects.

## Technologies Used

- Express.js
- Mongoose
- MongoDB
- Heroku
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Features

- **Mobile First Design**: The content has been formatted to anticipate the smallest screen width of 350px while still looking good on a desktop screen

- **Admin Dashboard**: I've built an admin dashboard that simplifies the process of adding or editing content on my webpage. This makes it easy for me to keep my portfolio current and relevant by filling out a form rather than having to update the code base.

- **Database Integration**: My portfolio leverages MongoDB with Mongoose to store project data. This ensures that all project information is securely managed and readily available for display.

- **Dynamic Content**: The projects and explorations sections are dynamically populated with data from the database, ensuring that visitors see the latest information about my work.

## Design

One of the highlights of this site is its unique design. I've explored neon colors as part of the color scheme, pushing the boundaries of self-expression while maintaining accessibility. This design choice reflects my love of synth wave and neon colors.

The footer of my portfolio presented a particularly interesting challenge. It uses CSS borders to create a simple triangle pattern. To accommodate various screen widths, I've implemented a JavaScript function that dynamically adjusts the number of triangles displayed, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.
